            <h3 style="font-size: larger; padding: 2px;">Sitabuldi Fort</h3>
            <p>Perched atop a twin hillock, Sitabuldi Fort is a poignant relic from the British era. It was the site of the pivotal Battle of Sitabuldi in 1817 and now houses an Indian Army memorial. History enthusiasts can visit the cell where Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned during India's struggle for independence.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: larger; padding: 2px;">Markanda</h3>
            <p>There are no places named "Narkanda" in or near Nagpur; it appears there is a misunderstanding, as Narkanda is a hill station in Himachal Pradesh, approximately 60 km from Shimla. For places and attractions in Nagpur, popular sites include Deekshabhoomi Stupa, the Zero Mile Stone, and various lakes like Futala and Ambazari</p>
